# 2-Stage-CE-amplifier

## ***Theory***
The process of increasing the strength of weak input signal in terms of voltage,current or power is known as amplification. When we cascode 2 CE amplifiers the gain gets multiplied so the overall gain is very high.

#### ***Why CE amplifier is used for high voltage/current gain?***
1. High Conductance
2. Collector Load Effect
3. Phase Reversal
4. Efficient power gain

#### ***Conditions to be met while designing CE amplifier***
1. To acheive maximum voltage swing (voltage drop across Rc is taken as Vcc/2)
2. Gain should be independent on Vbe and B(beta)
3. Ic should be independent of B(beta)
4. Power consumption is less than 200 mW.


### ***Enhancememt:***
We can add a voltage buffer for better performance with lower resistance loads.
